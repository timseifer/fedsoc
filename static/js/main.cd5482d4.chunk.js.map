The TUFS embraces the principle that the state exists to preserve freedom, that the separation of governmental powers is central to the integrity of the Constitution of the United States of America, and that the duty of the federal judiciary is to promote and uphold the Constitution as understood at the time of its writing, and oppose judgement of what the text “should be.”  The TUFS will promote these principles and beliefs through its activities and leadership. The TUFS will prioritize individual liberty, traditional, conservative values, and the rule of law within the legal system. It hopes to make significant impacts in the careers of future lawyers, legal scholars, judges, and professors, and in doing so, will remain committed to open discourse entirely free of bigotry.\n <p className =\"p\">\n SECTION 2-AFFILIATION WITH THE NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS\n </p>\n \n The TUFS is affiliated with and under the general supervision of the national organization located at:\n  \n The Federalist Society for Law & Public Policy Studies\n 1015 18th St., N.W.\n Suite 425\n Washington, DC 20036\n 888-489-8138\n www.fed-soc.org\n  \n The national organization retains all rights to terminate its relationship with the TUFS, and if such termination occurs, this organization must relinquish the title of “Federalist Society.”\n \n \n \n <p className =\"p\">\n SECTION 3-FACULTY ADVISOR\n </p>\n     The TUFS faculty advisor shall be a member of the faculty of the Tufts University School of Arts and Sciences or the Fletcher School of Global Affairs.
